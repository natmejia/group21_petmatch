# PetMatch – Group 21
Responsible Pet Adoption Platform

## Project Purpose
PetMatch is a conceptual application designed to improve the pet adoption process.
It connects potential adopters with pets using a matching system similar to Tinder, allowing shelters to manage profiles, communicate with adopters, and track adoption progress.
This project was created as part of a course assignment for practicing project planning, roadmapping, Basecamp organization, and GitHub version control.

## Features (Conceptual)
- User and shelter registration  
- Pet profiles with details and photos  
- Matching system (swipe-style)  
- Chat between adopters and shelters  
- Admin tools for shelters  
- Security and privacy considerations  

## Setup Instructions
Because this project is focused on planning and documentation, the repository contains:
- Project documentation  
- Milestones & roadmap notes  
- Basecamp organization references  
- Version tracking using Git commits  

No executable application is included at this stage.
